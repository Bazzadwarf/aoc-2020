# Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code 2020!

These are my solutions as of such you might find some janky code (no promises). **I highly suggest that you try completing them yourself first if you are following along!**

## How to run

This should compile and run with Visual Studio 2019 or later. I shouldn't have done anything funky so you can probably figure out how to compile and run it if you don't want to use VS.
